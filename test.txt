Dempsey was on the substitutes' bench for Fulham's first two away games of 2010–11, but became a regular starter, one of only five USA players in the Premier League to do so. On September 18, 2010, he scored an equalizing goal on 56 minutes with a header against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park in the 1–1 draw to continue Fulham's unbeaten record in the Barclays Premier League. On October 2, he scored against West Ham United past Robert Green, the same keeper that he had scored against in the World Cup. He then continued his form by scoring two goals against Wigan Athletic on October 30 as Fulham ran out 2–0 winners. On January 22, 2011, Dempsey scored another double versus Stoke City, putting Fulham temporarily out of relegation contention.
